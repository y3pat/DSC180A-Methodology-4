## Reflection Questions

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been everything related to the paper we are replicating. It is interesting to see how hospitals generally use a single disease oriented approach instead of taking comorbidities into account even though the paper by Zador et. al shows that comorbidities lead to higher rates of mortality, organ dysfunction, and sepsis. Furthermore, the method of creating multimorbidity subgroups in the paper is extremely interesting to me.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I'd like to pursue is using even more hospital data to create an app which utilizes all information a patient gives to analyze the percent risk of the patient contracting sepsis. The information would include the patient's pre-existing comorbidity history and much more. Using this information, doctor's can make much more informed decisions to get a patient the care they need before they get sepsis which would decrease mortality rates in hospitals.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
The Quarter 1 Project is just a paper replication so I believe it's difficult to relate the approach taken now to what will be taken in Quarter 2. However, a major change would be that both teams would work together and the project would be organized more like an actual work scenario (i.e. having backend team, frontend team, project manager, etc.).

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Considering the era of AI we are currently in, I would be interested in using LLMs within my group's project. I believe utilizing AI could improve the quality of our project's outcome in terms of accuracy and appearance.
